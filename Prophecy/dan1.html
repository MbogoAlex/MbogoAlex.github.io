			<h4 style="text-align: center;">DANIEL IN CAPTIVITY</h4>

		</div>
		<div style="text-align: justify;">
			<p style="font-weight: bold;">"Verse 1: In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged it. 2. And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God; which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure-house of his god." </p>
			<p>The historic section of the book of Daniel begins which with the exception of chapter 2, continues upto chapter 7 where the prophetic section begins. 
				<h4>We find the following historical facts:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>That Jehoiakim was king of Judah;</li>
					<li>That Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon;</li>
					<li>That Nebuchadnezzar came against Jehoiakim;</li>
					<li>That this was in the third year of Jehoiakim's reign; and</li>
					<li>Nebuchadnezzar conquered Jehoiakim and he took a portion of the vessels of the house of God to the land of Shinar(Babylon- Gen. 10;10) and placed them in the treasure house of his heathen divinity.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li>The overthrow of Jerusalem was predicted by Jeremiah(Jer. 25:8-11) and it was accomplished in B.C. 606.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">"Jer 25:8-11  8  Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, 9 Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the Lord, <span style="color: red;">and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations round about, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and an hissing, and perpetual desolations.</span> 10 Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. 11 And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years."</span></li>
					<li>This was the the first time that Jerusalem was taken by Nebuchadnezzar.</li>
					<li>Having revolted, the city was taken again by the same king twice subsequently being more severely delt which each exceeding time.</li>
					<li>The second was under Zedekiah who attempting to escape, was captured, his sons slain before him and his eyes put off and Ezekiel’s prophecy was fulfilled.</li>
					<li style="font-weight: bold;">"Eze 12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; <span style="color: red;">yet shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</span>"</li>
				</ul></p>
				<p>
					<h4>The sin of Israel</h4>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Jeremiah 17:24-27: 24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the Lord, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; 25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. 26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the Lord. 27 <span style="color: red;">But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</span></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>The Hebrew friends selected to serve the king</h4>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">Verse 3: And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king's seed, and of the princes; 4. Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. 5. And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's meat, and of the wine which he drank; so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>One may ask, were there no enough chaldeans to occupy these positions of trust and honour?</h4>
					The Chaldean youth could not compete with those of Israel in the qualifications, both mental and physical, necessary to such a position. God had given to the Israel nation a set of living principles which made them healthier than their neighbours in both body, mind and spirit.


				</p>
				<p>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Verse 6: Now among these were the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: 7. Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names; for he gave <span style="color: blue;">unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</span></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<h4>Why were they given new names?</h4>
					Probably it was because of the signification of the words.
					<ul>
						<li>Daniel – God is my judge</li>
						<li>Hananiah – gift of the Lord</li>
						<li>Mishael – He that is a strong God</li>
						<li>Azariah – help of the Lord</li>
					</ul>
					Their names had a reference to the true God of whom the Chaldeans considered there gods superior than.
					<h4>New names:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Belteshazzah – keeper of the hid treasures of Bel</li>
						<li>Shadrach – inspiration of the sun(which the Chaldeans worshipped)</li>
						<li>Meshach – goddess Shaca(Venus)</li>
						<li>Abednego – servant of the shining fire(also worshipped)</li>
					</ul>


				</p>

					<h4>Diet of the king is despised</h4>
					<span style="font-weight: bold;">Verse 8: But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself. 9. Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs. 10. And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who had appointed your meat and your drink; for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to the king. 11. Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 12. Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them give us pulse to eat, and water to drink. 13. Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king's meat; and as thou seest, deal with thy servants. 14. So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days. 15. And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat of the portion of the king's meat. 16. Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them pulse. </span>
				</p>
				<h4>Reason why Daniel and his friends refused the king’s food</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The food used by the kings of heathen nations was first offered in sacrifice to idols</li>
					<li>The wine was poured as libation to their gods</li>
					<li>Some of the meat was pronounced unclean by the Jewish law</li>
					<li>Their improved health at the end of the ten days may be attributed to God as a token of His approbation for the course they had taken.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
				    <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Verse 17: As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom; and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. 18. Now at the end of the days that the king had said that he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. 19. And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; therefore stood they before the king. 20. And in all matters of wisdom and understanding that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. 21. And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus."</span><p>At the end of three years, the king had a personal interview with the four Hebrew children(probably around 18-20 years old) and considered them ten times wiser than all the wise men of Babylon. This was a blessing from the Lord. The Lord honoured the four friends for honouring His name in Babylon.</p>
