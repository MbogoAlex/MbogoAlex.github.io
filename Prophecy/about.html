		    <p>The voice of prophecy was first heard in Eden when God declared that the snake shall bite the heel of the seed of the woman but the seed of the woman shall crush the snake's head. Enoch, the seventh from Adam also prophesied of the coming of the Lord for so, the apostle Jude declares, "And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, <span style="font-weight: bold;">Behold, the Lord
cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
ungodly among them, of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their
hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him." Jude 14,15.</span></p>
		    <p>
		    	The fulfillment of prophecy has been but history's response to prophecy thus giving us more confidence in the scriptures for the word of the Lord endures forever.
		    </p>
		    <p>The study of prophecy should by no means be neglected; for it is the prophetic portions of
the word of God which especially constitute it a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. So both David
and Peter unequivocally testify. Ps.119:105; 2 Peter 1:19.</p>
				<p>Bearing this in mind, should we fill our lives with vanity? "Why", says the prophet, "do you spend money in that which is not food?" How do you spend your time? Money? How do you use your talent? Influence?</p>
				<p>God in His gracious mercy has given us the sure word of prophecy. The neglected words of the bible are a ray which shall guide the path of the reader. But woe unto him who doesn't study prophecy! The Lord will come as a thief to him. This website is dedicated to the careful study of the books of Daniel and Revelation. We study prophecy and see history's response to it. We study how prophecy was fulfilled, is being fulfilled and what is predicted to happen in the near future. This will help us in preparing to meet the future.<br>God bless you!</p>
