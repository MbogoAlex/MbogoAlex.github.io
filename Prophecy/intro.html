				We have Daniel as a perfect example of someone who had true wisdom. The bible declares:<span style="font-weight: bold;">And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.Job 28:28: </span> The wisdom of Daniel had become proverbial for Ezekiel prophecying to the king of Tyrus(Satan), states: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:Ezekiel 28:3. </span> But above all, the Lord recognized him as a prophet of God and bade his disciples to study his prophecy for the benefit of the church.<span style="font-weight: bold;">"When ye
therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy
place (whoso readeth, let him understand), then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains."
Matt.24:15,16. </span>
			</p>
			<p>The prophecy of Daniel gives a consecutive history of the world from that time to the end of the world. It gave a chronological prophecy of the coming of the Messiah so clearly that the Jews forbade any attempt to interpret its numbers since that prophecy would show them to be without excuse in rejecting the Messiah</p>
			<p>Daniel is supposed to have died at Susa, in Persia, about the year B.C.530, aged nearly 94 years. </p>
